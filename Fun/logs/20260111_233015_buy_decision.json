    "reason": "No candidate matches the prior WON TIER 2-style high-momentum pattern with BTC stable and strong 4H confirmation: SOL has good momentum but was a recent LOST strategy; AERO/FET are Tier 1-style setups similar to multiple recent LOSSES; TAO lacks volatility; PENDLE is overextended (RSI ~67, +6.8% with VW-RSI >70, close to overbought/chasing). Best to stay in cash and avoid forcing a trade."
