    "reason": "No candidates meet strict criteria: None have 4H Strong Buy (only 1H signals provided); all high gains (>8%) with RSI mostly >60 indicate chasing overbought TIER 2+ setups like recent LOST trades (e.g., TRUST-USDC +8.3% RSI56); BTC -1.07% dip lacks relative strength decoupling; avoid repeating LOST TIER 1 patterns."
