      "reason": "P&L is small (-0.2%, well above panic and profit thresholds), price is above ATR stop (0.506 > 0.4883), BTC is neutral and higher-timeframe technicals are BUY/STRONG_BUY with mid-band RSI ~55 matching the calmer TIER 1-style profiles of prior WON trades; no rule-based exit trigger hit, so continue standard swing hold while avoiding premature cut similar to recent LOSERS."
