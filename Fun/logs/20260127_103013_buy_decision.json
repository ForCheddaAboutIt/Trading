    "reason": "No candidates meet criteria without repeating LOST TIER 1/2 strategies (e.g., ASTER-PROMPT RSI/gain similar to multiple LOSTs); PROMPT RSI 56.6 ideal but +11.4% exceeds TIER limits and chases; AKT/LIGHTER high gains >5-13% with VW-RSI>75-78 overbought risk; ZEC RSI 67.7 too high, MACD bearish; BTC neutral, no relative strength needed but no perfect setup."
