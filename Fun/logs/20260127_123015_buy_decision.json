    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "No candidates meet strict criteria without repeating LOST TIER 1 strategies (e.g., PROMPT/AKT RSI 50-60 + high gain failed recently); all have high gains >7% (chasing risk), many RSI near/above 70 or VW-RSI >75 (overbought), MACD not clearly bullish crossover; BTC neutral, no relative strength exception; prioritize patience per rules."
