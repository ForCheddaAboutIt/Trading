PAXG-USDC RSI 73.2 (overbought, >75 threshold breached). Neither candidate matches WON pattern (AERO/ROSE: TIER 1 with RSI 50-60 + moderate 3-6% gains). Recent LOST trades show TIER 1 setups with higher gains (6.9%, 7.5%) led to losses\u2014current candidates repeat this mistake. Patience critical: wait for BTC stabilization + altcoin with RSI 50-60 + 3-5% gain matching proven AERO/ROSE winning strategy."
