    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "Search results indicate momentum is weakening across key crypto levels[5], and December market conditions show deteriorating sentiment[7]. BTC's 24h gain of +1.50% lacks the strong trending conviction needed for reliable 1-5 day momentum trades with 8-15% targets. Search results emphasize that Bitcoin requires either large range days (7%+ moves) to generate continuation[2] or alignment with positive risk sentiment, neither of which current conditions support. Available capital ($19.26) limits position sizing effectiveness. Recommend awaiting clearer momentum confirmation before deploying capital."
