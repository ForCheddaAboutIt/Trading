RSI 48.1 approaching ideal 50-60 zone suggests potential upside. 1H SELL signal conflicts with 4H BUY and bullish technicals (MACD positive, high volume). Maintain position pending RSI recovery to 50-60 range or price break above $0.0114 resistance. Exit if price closes below ATR stop or BTC triggers panic exit (<-2%)."
