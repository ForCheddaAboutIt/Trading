Current price within predicted range ($0.01233-$0.01292 this week)[1]. BTC neutral (-0.81%) removes panic exit trigger. Technicals mixed (1H neutral, 4H buy) but fundamentals support holding: bullish sentiment[1], 60% green days[1], all EMA indicators showing BUY signals[1]. Entry matched winning ROSE-USDC pattern successfully. Hold through ATR stop at $0.0120; exit only if price breaks below stop or RSI exceeds 70 (overbought reversal risk)."
