Current price $0.01215 > ATR Stop $0.0119. 1H SELL signal concerning but 4H NEUTRAL and RSI 43.2 (not oversold) suggest consolidation rather than breakdown. Entry matched winning ROSE pattern with strong technicals at entry. BTC neutral (-0.54%) provides no panic trigger. Monitor for ATR stop breach; exit if price closes below $0.0119."
