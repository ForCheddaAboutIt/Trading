    "reason": "No ideal setup available. ZEC (+10.1%, RSI 59.4) is closest to TIER 1 but MACD is deeply negative (-4.01/-4.76), signaling weakening momentum\u2014contradicts bullish setup. ALGO, JTO, LTC all show RSI 63-69 (TIER 2 hot zone) with strong gains, but recent losses on identical TIER 1/2 setups (TRUST, ASTER, SUPER all lost -1.8% to -3.2%) indicate this strategy is currently failing. SYRUP is overbought (RSI 73.9, VW-RSI 78.5)\u2014avoid chasing. BTC +1.75% is mildly bullish but insufficient to override weak candidate quality. Better to preserve capital and wait for cleaner MACD confirmation or RSI pullback to 50-60 range with bullish MACD crossover."
