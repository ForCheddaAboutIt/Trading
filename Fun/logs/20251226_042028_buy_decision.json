    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "Momentum weakens across key crypto levels according to weekly and monthly indicators[7]. December market conditions show investor retreat and market slides[6]. With only $19.51 capital and weakening momentum signals despite some coin rallies, deploying funds in current conditions carries elevated risk. Bitcoin's +1.14% shows modest movement, and while PRCL (+16.9%) appears strong, it may be trailing after the move. Await clearer momentum confirmation before entering positions."
