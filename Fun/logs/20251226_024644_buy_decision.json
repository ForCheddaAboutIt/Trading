    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "Weekly and monthly indicators show weakening momentum across key crypto levels[7]. BTC at +1.63% 24h lacks the 7%+ continuation pattern required for high-probability momentum plays[2]. With $19.26 capital and BTC at $89,210, position size would be negligible. Waiting for stronger momentum confirmation before deployment."
