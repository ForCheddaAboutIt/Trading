    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "All positions are very small, very recently opened, and near breakeven (SUSHI and APT slightly green, ADA and GRT roughly flat). With no strong profit to lock in and no outsized loss to cut, there is no compelling risk or capital-efficiency reason to sell any specific asset right now."
