    "reason": "BTC is near an all-time high around a major psychological level (~$87k) with flat 24h change (-0.51%), indicating momentum cooling rather than expanding. Large continuation moves in BTC tend to follow 7%+ days and clean breaks of key round levels to the next 5k band, which is not present here.[2] Broader commentary notes weakening momentum on higher timeframes across crypto, suggesting reduced edge for short-term breakout longs at current levels.[5] Without clear evidence of a fresh breakout, outsized volume surge, or coin-specific catalyst in the listed markets, the probability of a 1\u20135 day 8\u201315% follow-through move with favorable reward/risk is not attractive. Capital is better preserved for a cleaner high-momentum setup."
