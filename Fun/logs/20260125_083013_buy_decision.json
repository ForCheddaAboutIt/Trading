    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "BTC -1.03% dip requires relative strength exception (alt outperforming significantly); no candidate shows perfect tiered confirmation without TIER 1 RSI 50-60 + 3-5% gain or avoiding recent LOST TIER 1 patterns (e.g., KTA close but RSI 58 with BTC dip; others TIER 2+ with high RSI/gains >5% or chasing like WCT +25.9%). Patience critical per rules."
