      "reason": "Normal swing trade: P&L +0.6% (<5% so no profit target), BTC -1.66% but PANIC EXIT rule not triggered (BTC > -2% and position is profitable), price above ATR stop (0.1292 > 0.1266), 1H STRONG_BUY / 4H BUY, RSI 57.1 and VW-RSI not overbought\u2014all consistent with prior WON Tier 1 pattern and explicitly avoids cutting early like recent LOST Tier 1 trades."
