    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "BTC is down 0.32% with weakening momentum across key equity and crypto levels[5], market slide deepening in December[7], and no clear short-term breakouts or positive catalysts in top markets; prefer liquid assets like BTC/ETH/SOL but current conditions lack 8-15% upside potential for 1-5 day plays amid risk-off sentiment."
