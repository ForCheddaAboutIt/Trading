    "reason": "No winning strategies in recent lessons to repeat; all listed are LOST (TIER 1/2 and relative strength failed). Current candidates lack perfect tier fit: PROMPT/AKT/ZEC high gains but RSI 53-70 (Tier 2+), VW-RSI often >70 overbought; ASTER/AXS borderline but match prior LOST TIER 1 logic. BTC neutral, no clear edge\u2014patience rules."
