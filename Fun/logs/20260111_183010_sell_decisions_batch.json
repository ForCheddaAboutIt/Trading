      "base_size": "50.24",
      "reason": "Normal holding: PnL -1.4% (> -2% so no panic exit), profit target not hit (< 5%), price is above ATR stop (0.50 > 0.4824), BTC neutral and 1H/4H trend intact with mid-range RSI 52; aligns with calmer TIER 1-style WINNER logic and avoids cutting early like recent LOSERS."
