    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "Insufficient real-time data on intraday price action, volume surges, and news flow across the listed pairs to reliably identify a 1\u20135 day momentum setup with 8\u201315% upside and controlled downside. Without concrete confirmation of a fresh breakout or strong volume-backed trend in one of the liquid majors (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.), any specific BUY call would be guesswork rather than a signal grounded in current momentum conditions. Preserving capital until a clearly defined, high-conviction momentum move appears is the higher-quality decision here."
