Macro backdrop supportive: whale accumulation, exchange supply shock (19.7K BTC outflow), and altcoin momentum (Ethereum +16.3%, Solana +17.7% 30-day) suggest capital rotating into higher-beta assets. BTC -2.65% does not trigger panic exit threshold (-2% on negative position). Hold through trend continuation."
