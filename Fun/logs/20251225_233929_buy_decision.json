    "action": "BUY",
    "product_id": "SOL-USDC",
    "quote_size": "17.50",
    "reason": "Capital is small and experimental, so priority is liquid large-caps with strong upside asymmetry rather than ultra-safe blue-chip BTC at all-time highs. Among available markets, SOL offers a leading high-throughput L1 with deep liquidity and high beta relative to BTC and ETH, making it suitable for a small, asymmetric swing position. Size is limited to 50% of USDC to manage downside while leaving dry powder for future entries or averaging if volatility increases."
