      "reason": "P&L is -3.0% (<5% target) so this is a NORMAL HOLDING; BTC is only -0.79% so PANIC EXIT rule is NOT triggered; price (136.07) remains above ATR_STOP (133.31) so ATR STOP rule is NOT triggered. Despite 1H SELL / 4H NEUTRAL and RSI cooling to 43.7, system rules prioritize holding while above ATR stop and before -2% BTC dump, in line with the controlled momentum profile used in the prior POL-USDC WIN rather than cutting early like recent LOSERS."
