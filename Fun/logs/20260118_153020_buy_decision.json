    "reason": "TIER 1 Setup: RSI 59.0 (ideal 50-60 range), +2.8% 24h gain (3-5% target), STRONG_BUY 1H signal, MACD bullish (0.04/0.04). Matches WON AERO/ROSE pattern: moderate volatility with RSI in sweet spot avoids overbought trap. BTC neutral (-0.26%) removes headwind. Capital allocation: 80% (21.77/27.21) per TIER 1 protocol. Avoids LOST trap: rejects ME/RARE/L3/ACH due to RSI >60 or gains >15% (chasing/overbought risk)."
