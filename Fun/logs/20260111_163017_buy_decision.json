    "reason": "TIER 1-style setup closely matching prior WON AAVE/POL pattern: RSI 55.6 in 50\u201360 ideal band, 24h gain +3.5% in 3\u20135% window, BTC stable/up, MACD slightly bullish/flat (no bearish cross), volatility adequate but not runaway; avoids HOT overextended profiles like high-RSI TIER 2 and extreme momentum that resembled recent LOSERS, prioritizing the calmer, mid-RSI, mid-gain structure that defined previous WINNERS while keeping some capital in reserve for risk control."
