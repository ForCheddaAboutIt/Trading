    "reason": "No coins show 5-15% multi-timeframe momentum; ALEPH-USDC (+57.5% 24h/1H, +51.1% 4H) exceeds 30% threshold indicating potential pump-and-dump. YB-USDC (+19.2%), FLOCK-USDC (+18.2%) also too high. PLUME-USDC (+11.7%), SUP-USDC (+10.0%), SYRUP-USDC (+9.3%) in range but lack strongest alignment per multi-timeframe research favoring trend confirmation across frames[1][2]."
