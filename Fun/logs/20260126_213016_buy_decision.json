ZEC/VVV/SYRUP exceed RSI 64 (overbought risk). JTO is closest (RSI 60.4, +12.2%, STRONG_BUY signal, MACD near zero) but MACD lacks bullish confirmation (Line not > Signal). ALGO shows better MACD structure but RSI 62 + 6.8% gain still mirrors failed TIER 1 setups. BTC +1.64% is bullish but insufficient to override weak individual setups. Patience required\u2014wait for RSI 50-60 range with MACD Line > Signal Line crossover."
