    "product_id": "SUPER-USDC",
    "quote_size": "18.10",
    "reason": "TIER 1 Setup: RSI 54.9 (ideal 50-60 range), +5.2% 24h gain (within 3-5% target), 1H STRONG BUY signal, MACD neutral but not conflicting. Matches WON pattern: moderate RSI + moderate volatility + strong technicals. Capital allocation 80% (18.10/22.62) per TIER 1 protocol. Avoids LOST trap: rejecting AVNT/ROSE/ZORA due to RSI >60 and/or gains >15% (overbought/chasing risk evident in recent losses)."
