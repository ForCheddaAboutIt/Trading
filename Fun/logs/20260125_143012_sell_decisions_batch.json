      "reason": "Position -2.4% below entry; RSI 48.4 (ideal 50-60 range) suggests potential recovery; ATR stop $0.1923 not breached; 1H NEUTRAL/4H BUY supports holding. Search results show mixed sentiment (bearish near-term per CoinCodex[1], but potential upside Feb-Mar[2]). Current price $0.2043 above ATR stop. Avoid panic exit; monitor for RSI recovery toward 50-60 zone and 4H BUY confirmation before adding or exiting."
