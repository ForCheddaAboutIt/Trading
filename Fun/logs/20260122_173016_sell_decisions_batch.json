      "reason": "Position +0.38% with price $0.012275 above ATR stop $0.0120. RSI 46.5 (neutral zone, not overbought). 1H SELL signal conflicts with 4H BUY and bullish technicals (EMA 5/10/21/50/100 all BUY)[1]. Entry matched winning ROSE-USDC pattern with ideal RSI 50-60 zone and strong volume. Price predictions show modest near-term gains (1.13% by Feb 21)[1]. Hold while price remains above stop and trend intact; monitor for break below $0.0120 or RSI compression below 40."
