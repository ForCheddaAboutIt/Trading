    "reason": "TIER 1 Setup matching WON ROSE-USDC pattern: +5.5% 24h gain (within 3-5% ideal range), RSI 60.0 (perfect 50-60 tier), STRONG_BUY 1H signal, high volume (29.6M). Despite BTC -2.35% headwind, SAND shows relative strength decoupling. Capital sizing 80% per TIER 1 protocol. Avoids LOST logic (ZRO/BERA chasing >6% gains, AXS/KTA overbought RSI >70, ZRO repeat failure)."
