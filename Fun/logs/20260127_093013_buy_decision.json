    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "No winning strategies in recent lessons to repeat; all listed are LOST (TIER 1/2 setups and relative strength failed). Current candidates show high gains (>4%) with RSI 56-60 but VW-RSI often >70 (overbought risk per [1][2]); MACD flat or marginal (not clear bullish cross per [1][3]); BTC neutral, no relative strength exception; avoid repeating lost logic."
