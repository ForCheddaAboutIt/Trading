    "reason": "Insufficient real-time momentum data. Search results lack current 24h price action for ETH, SOL, MATIC, AVAX, LINK; no real-time RSI/MACD/volume indicators provided. Bitcoin shows modest +1.38% momentum, but December market conditions show weakening momentum across key crypto levels[5]. Without current technical confirmation (RSI, MACD crossovers, breakout levels, volume) for 1-5 day entry setups, responsible momentum trade identification is not possible. Recommend waiting for stronger directional confirmation and clearer breakout signals above round number resistance levels[2]."
