      "reason": "Position -0.8% (within normal holding range <5%). Current price $0.1686 > ATR Stop $0.1615. Technical indicators show RSI 48.0 (neutral, not oversold) and mixed signals (1H SELL/4H BUY). On-chain data bullish: Daily Active Addresses at 3-month highs, Open Interest surging, volume rising. If MANA closes above 100-day EMA at $0.176, upside to 200-day EMA at $0.218 is likely. Avoid panic exit; trend not broken. Monitor for break below ATR stop or confirmation of 1H sell signal with volume."
