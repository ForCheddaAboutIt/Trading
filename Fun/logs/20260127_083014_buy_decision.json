    "reason": "No winning strategies in recent lessons to repeat; all listed are LOST (TIER 1/2 setups and relative strength failed). Candidates show high gains (>8%) with RSI mostly 58-75 (Tier 2 or overbought risk, avoid >75 per rules), many VW-RSI >70 indicating overbought; BTC neutral, no perfect tiered confirmation without repeating lost logic."
