      "reason": "P&L at +5.5% (>5% target) but technicals are near-parabolic: 1H/4H BUY, RSI 62.1 (strong but not overbought), price above ATR stop and trend intact. No PANIC EXIT trigger, BTC neutral, setup matches prior WON Tier 1 logic and avoids chasing/late entries seen in recent LOST trades. Maintain until clear momentum fade or RSI pushes into true overbought/acceleration exhaustion."
