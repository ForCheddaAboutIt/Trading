    "action": "HOLD",
    "reason": "BTC dropping -3.06% (> -2% threshold: DO NOT BUY). No candidates show Relative Strength exception (all alts positive but BTC deeply red prevents entry). AXS/ZRO/ROSE/KTA/SAND all RSI 60+ (TIER 2 or overbought, avoid chasing >15% gains like LOST BERA). Matches patience rule over weak setups; repeat WON ROSE logic requires ideal TIER 1 without BTC dip."
