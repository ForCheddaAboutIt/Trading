Wait, no: 0.56495 > 0.5495, but entry 0.57228, stop_loss 0.543666; however RSI 47.1 low/neutral (1H NEUTRAL), trend not accelerating like WON patterns (e.g. AERO prior 6.4% had momentum); avoids LOST TIER1 chasing (STX/AKT), BTC neutral but position underwater - cut loss per NORMAL HOLDING rule as trend broken."
