      "reason": "P&L is -1.7% (no panic exit), profit target not hit, price remains above ATR stop (0.3839 > 0.3720), BTC is neutral, and this is a TIER 1-style setup modeled on prior WON AAVE/POL trades. 1H has cooled to NEUTRAL with RSI 51.7 but trend is still intact on 4H BUY, so per strategy rules this remains a normal swing hold while above ATR stop and without clear trend break."
